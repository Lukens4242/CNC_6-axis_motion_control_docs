# CNC_6-axis_motion_control_docs - Why?
Documentation for construction of the CNC 6-axis motion controlled camera platform by DIW

This is my work to document what it takes to print, construct, wire, and configure the [CNC 6-axis motion controlled camera platform](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4652484) by **Do It Whenever**.

He has a few really intriguing videos on YT as well that walk through why he did it and what it can do.

There are several pieces that will be needed in order to build this poject.  I will be constructing them as I go through it.  If you are looking at this on github, then you have all the work I've written as of this point.  I'll update sections as I have more information.
* Printed Parts BOM
* Mechanical (and electromechanical) Hardware BOM
* Electronic Components BOM
* The writeup below explaining how to put all this together

# 3D Printed Parts
Here is a link to the [BOM of printed parts](/BOM 3d printed parts.ods).

I organized things by several colors.  You will have the following that you can choose as you wish.  I color coded certain components to match up with the color of the release buttons caps, so less thinking was involved.  That is to say, I thought that pressing the blue release button and have it unlock the axis with the blue gears and components would be relatively intuitive.
* Base color
* Accent color
* Control Button Color #1
* Control Button Color #2
* Control Button Color #3
* Control Button Color #4
* Control Button Color #5
* Control Button Color #6
